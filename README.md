**Profit-Loss calculator** is a stock based application that checks if you have made a profit or a loss, based on the **Selling Price, Quantity of Stocls and Cost Price**. It shows loss with red color text and profit with green color text

### Technologies Used:
1) HTML.
2) CSS.

***
**Brief:** In this application, I have took data from input boxes and using **querySelectors** I have stored them in variables. I have used a **Button** and added event listeners
on **click** function. And used an **clear** button to clear the inputs and output, so no need to refresh.. All the computations are done once the event calls the function submit handler.

#### What Next?
The next input options are available only when first one is filled and add a calculator as well.

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
